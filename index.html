<br><h1>Welcome to my story of inactive port Ports. It is a nice story.</h1>
<h3><b><align="left">WATCHING OUT FOR INACTIVE PORTS</b></h3>
<p>Not too long I was working in a classroom when a lab technician came in to replace monitor. The old monitor had long since been removed. He reached around with the cable, plug it in to the back of the computer, and return it on. Unfortunately, the monitor simply give a default message indicating that it was not connceted. He thought that the cable might have been bad, so he went and rectify another cable but still had the same problem. He didn't gave up but was momentarily stumped and asked for my advice. I remeber how easy it is to use the inactive port and wondered aloud if the PC had inactive video port. My eyes lit up and i said to myself, 'Yes' I had seen this before". This time I got on my hands and knees to look at the port and realized that was exaclty the problem. I swapped the cable and the monitor worked perfectly. It is very easy to plug a monitor into the inactive port and even season the techinicain can sometimes be confused by this.  If you dont have a display when plugging a new monitor doublecheck the port you are using.<br><br><b>Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it.</b><hr><br></p>
